# Hi there, I'm Peter Tran! üëã Welcome to my profile

I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Calgary, with a previous background in Supply Chain Management. I found my true passions to be in technology, particularly in human-computer interactions & software engineering, where I can dream and build my ideas, and see how the tools I make can make an impact to everyone. My particular interests are in web development, UX&D, and game design.
